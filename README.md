Challenge 1 - Easy:
Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
Display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

Challenge 2 - Moderate:
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.
Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
The total Volume of the stock
Ticker symbol
Include conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Challenge 3 - Hard:
The solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.
The solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
Make the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.


# CHALLENGE
Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it
once. This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

# Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you
to test faster. Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive
task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
